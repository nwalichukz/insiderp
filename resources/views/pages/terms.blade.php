                                Cancellation of an ongoing job attracts penalty. When a project is cancelled by the the client the money 
                                paid would not be returned totally to him depending on the number of days that the project has been ongoing.
                                The amount to refund will be determined  by the number of days divided by the amount paid multiply by how many days
                                the job has been ongoing. Then when the vendor cancels the job she losses everything and the money returned to the
                                client minus the bank charges for the transactions. Also the vendors reputation would be affected negatively. And such
                                subsequent behaviour may attract suspension.
